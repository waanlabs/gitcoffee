## FreeBSD

A FreeBSD port `www/gitea` is available. To install the pre-built binary package:

pkg install gitea
```

For the most up to date version, or to build the port with custom options,
[install it from the port](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html):

```
su -
cd /usr/ports/www/gitea
make install clean
```

The port uses the standard FreeBSD file system layout: config files are in `/usr/local/etc/gitea`,
bundled templates, options, plugins and themes are in `/usr/local/share/gitea`, and a start script
is in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/gitea`.

To enable Gitea to run as a service, run `sysrc gitea_enable=YES` and start it with `service gitea start`.

## Others

Various other third-party packages of Gitea exist.
